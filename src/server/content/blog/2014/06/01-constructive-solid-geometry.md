### Constructive Solid Geometry Part 1

There's been a lot of incremental work in the game engine. Every scene has had a bit of work put into it. 

Here's a look at the new Sandbox mode, which allows playing around with Constructive Solid Geometry techniques (https://github.com/chandlerprall/ThreeCSG) to help design new objects and environments.

I'll be posting an update to the Staging area once I have cleaned up a bit more of the website.
