### THREE.JS and Live2D are up and running
_18th of December 2016_

The biggest thing I've wanted to achieve since first seeing the [Live2D WebGL demo](http://app2.live2d.com/a/wg/ie.html) was to have my own manga looking characters. The Jack demo seen in the interactive hero area above is my first proof of concept. Building a new website has afforded me a clean overhead to play with new code :D I've opted to immediately try running multiple canvases and made the logo a WebGL canvas as well.

The next stage in development is to get the website content filled out and then styled up. It's always a bit of schlep for me as a developer.. trying to write content, come up with design and also put together a future-proofish framework for repeating this work in the future. Using [Github Issues](https://github.com/paulbrzeski/Langenium/issues) to plan my work and track where I'm up to and what I'm doing has been super handy.
