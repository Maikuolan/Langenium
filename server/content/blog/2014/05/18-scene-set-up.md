### Scene set-up

Set up some rudimentary lights, added an extra room and removed the wireframes.

Next up - windows! Once those are in, the station will be ready to go into the space scene!

Collision detection is working and I'm using a geometry plugin to merge basic shapes into the rooms seen here.

Next step is room details and tweaks to lighting. I may also work on some basic interaction - pick up a sparkling item, use a computer console etc.
