### Langenium: Epoch Exordium (E.E.)

![Epoch Exordium Poster](./assets/content/feature1.png)

An adventure RPG with resource management elements from RTS.

This tells the story of human explorers of a network of space stations that were built by automated drones at the direction of an AI.

## Purpose
This mini-game is mainly for me to build up game mechanics and functionality in the engine.

Epoch Exordium leads into the world of 2099. It serves as a transitionary piece from today's world into the Earth that will fall at the start of Langenium proper.

Exordium is an element developed by humans, under WERP's instruction. It's named for being a new beginning for humanity.

The game's story is the Epoch of Exordium and the prologue for how WERP took control of the human race and brought them to Ibidan "an Epoch Exordium", introduction to the main story :)

#### Storyline

##### Prologue

In the early 21st century, the human race was in a crisis. The oil had run dry and food was scarce due to dangerous and unpredictable weather patterns. 

A computer was made, unlike any other. The Web Energy Research Project (WERP) sought to create a human brain that could solve the energy crisis and ensure the survival of the human race. The brain was given a home in the sky and hidden from all humans, knowing that it's mission would keep it in check - create clean energy and ensure the human race's survival.

WERP came online in 2039 and revolutionized the fields of astrophyics, biology, chemistry, quantum physics and mathematics. It did all this by exploring and cataloging the internet and then producing models and prototypes for the humans to learn from.

By 2040, all forms of private transportation became illegal. Unrest, crime and rioting ensued, however no solution came about. WERP was put to the task, and determined that humanity must create a new element for a new age - Exordium.

Exordium would capture gamma rays in a crystalline structure and then release it in the form of electricity. It seemed perfect, unfortunately there was no way to make it.

2045. Construction drones designed and built by WERP were rocketed onto the moon. The drones harvested raw materials, surviving off cosmic radiation and trace gases they eventually began to replicate and left the moon for the asteroid belt, and beyond. The human race was completely unaware of all of this and lived on, as well as they could.

For 31 years, WERP sat in silence. As time had passed, astronomers had observed structures being built all around the solar system. There were theories - that WERP was hard at work, piloting each and every single drone remotely and thus limiting it's ability to work on anything else or even communicate.

2076. On an ordinary day, inboxes all around the world were flooded with one message - "It's ready. Come forth.". There was a lot of confusion, but some brave souls decided to head for the stars to find see if the answer could be found - somewhere out there in space.

##### Epoch Exordium Story

Project Humanity (PH) is founded by the UN in 2077. The organization was given the same mandate as WERP - create clean energy and protect the human race. PH was told that they would assemble teams from all around the world who would go out into space and find out what WERP had built and why.

Engineers, scientists, passionate sci-fi nerds and entrepreneurs were brought up to the delapitated International Space Station for a debriefing and deployment. It turns out that WERP had developed a form of public transportation - a network of ballistic capsule cannons and nets that would allow cargo and people to move safely between structures.

##### SPOILERIFIC EPIC CONCLUSION OF STORY NOTES

WERP is using the network as part of his long term plan to destroy the Earth in 23 years and relocate the humans to Ibidan.

The stations could be used to both determine the trajectory of the wormhole and a way to create the ideal conditions for it.

##### Ideas
- Detonating the stations in a certain order could create some kind of gravitational disturbance that rips the Earth->Ibidan wormhole open.
	- Twin wormholes open - one between Earth and the surface of the sun and one between Earth and Ibidan
	- Wormhole is 'shifting' and in the process of stabilizing it's simply superheated plasma/exotic particles entering the Earth's atmosphere that causes the explosion
- The stations could funnel laser/maser/kinetic energy into the Earth in a way that rips the wormhole open
	- The station is at the L3 point to Earth and the "poof" of the wormhole being established between these locations caused a massive solar flare to hit the Earth's atmosphere

Due to the player's having their brains harvested at the end of Epoch Exordium - there could be moments in Langenium MMO where this past character contacts the same players Langenium character via cryptic clues and messages. This could be in their own past and resonance with recent events or direct things like receiving a random reward from that character as an inheritance. Maybe completing different optional objectives in Epoch Exordium could create greater rewards and longer term missions that appear - maybe even discovering more about what WERP did overall, as part of your own story in both games?


##### Gameplay

###### Objective Ideas
- Build a new station
	- Every station created spawns a new unique component, which then becomes required for every new station built
	- later down in the game, players will be able to 
		- 'place' their station in the available locations
			- They will need to choose what to orbit and use a combination of Lagrange calculations to determine the position
		- Go to various stations to gather certain component blueprints
		- Go to various stations to organize the harvest/production of raw materials and delivery to that location
		- Recruit drones in the network to come and build the station (drones migrate between the asteroid belt for harvest, stations to repair and any position facing the sun to recharge)
	- the incentive is
		- the completion of the construction of a station is the endgame
		- player's brain is harvested to be used as the on-station AI for what they built
		- brain memories contain "so much more" than the instruments of a computer can measure in the same timespan - each human brain is an ideal component for expanding individual nodes of the network. he too has an artificial organic brain and understands well that the human ego has a limited view on the memories in the brain, and that he'd be able to easily parse through their experiences and instill a superior personality based on himself. This eventually turns out to have backfired when players in Langenium MMO start hearing from the harvested brain people via random inheritance, lost+found datalogs, etc. Some of the explorers were able to fight back against the WERP persona within them and retain their individuality... while being a space station.
		- WERP is using the generations of clones derived from the genetic pool of the original team to 'breed' the perfect cycle of explorers for his task. The number of player deaths is the number of times "this explorer" has been cloned for use by the system.
		- WERP entices the explorers by making them think that they are cracking some kind of elusive mystery, when they are simply gathering the data WERP needs in their heads by witnessing key events at each station and performing certain tasks
- Exploring the network
	- Discover hidden information about the backstory from datalogs left behind by other explorers and news articles from Earth - accessed by a console
	- Discover the GARDEN OF BABYLON IN SPACE, which you will need to maintain your food/water supply (you're basically a hitchhiker on this network, with no equipment but your PDA)
	- Sleep in bunks or in your sleeping bag to recharge your sleep levels - warnings will come up saying you need to sleep, but you can ignore them. if SLEEP depletes you black out and an overlay says "You went insane, stripped naked and took a stroll out the airlock. Try sleeping next time, K?". You respawn at the starting point
	- Dodge asteroids, space junk while traversing a guided obstacle course
		- Dodge rocks, ice and garbage from the drone construction
		- Manouvre the shuttle into certain positions for 'bonuses' of some kind
			- Explanation could be for surveying purposes or getting slight speed bonuses
		- Impact doesn't stop you, but it slows you down
			- Unmanageable deceleration results in being lost in space and dying - you respawn at the first station if you die (as explained by the end-game, you are actually coming back as a different person)
	- Eventually, players will discover that they can build new stations, and that the system is waiting for 'human input' in order to proceed with the next stage of construction
- Completing missions
	- Unlock missions and activities by travelling to stations with different capabilities
	- Missions from Earth
		- Explore every station
		- Determine the purpose of the network
		- Make contact with WERP
	- Missions from exploration (explained to be the player's own curiosity... maybe stick it in some kind of traveller's log as a self assigned goal?)
		- Item retrieval/delivery - certain devices need to be delivered from point A to B and operated by a human
			- "Find a plot device" that is mentioned 
			- "Take the plot device to station X" that is mentioned 
			- "Place the plot device in the theatric device" that then does some SFX show
		- Raw material sourcing
			- Check survey data and deploy drones to new areas for harvesting materials, you can send instructions to any drone but it'll create problems for your supply line
			- The stations will direct the players to gather these raw materials, as part of conversations with onboard AI
		- Produce exordium for Earth - datalogs explain that this is the point of this entire setup, to create clean energy for Earth
			- Players discover that the space stations are for building a new clean source that can only be made in space - Exordium
			- Players pick an area with available drones and organize supply routes of resources to their current location
			- Players set a 'home station' and park there. Their aim is to get the supply line feeding to this station. If players change stations, any materials collected have to either be transported manually via capsule (per station) or ejected into space
			- Each station is capable of producing exordium, but the device needs all the right materials. Exordium is shipping back to Earth via the back supply line.
			- Every station producing exordium unlocks a previously inaccessible area (due to air shortage/low power)
			- These inaccessible areas are key to discovering the secret to building new stations - whether it is retrieving an item like a blueprint or performing a weird arbitrary science experiment
