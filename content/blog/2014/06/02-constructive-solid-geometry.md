### Constructive Solid Geometry Part 2

Using [ThreeCSG](https://github.com/chandlerprall/ThreeCSG)

Got multi-material CSG working 

Now I can merge/subtract/intersect objects and retain the materials of all previous objects. I could cross a basic rectangle of metal with one of glass to create a window or more interesting room!
